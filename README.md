An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) e-commerce back end streamlines the interaction between the web application and the database by converting data into objects, eliminating the need for raw SQL queries. It allows developers to manage products, orders, users, and inventory using object-oriented code, which improves code readability and maintainability. ORM frameworks also enhance security by preventing SQL injection attacks and simplify tasks like schema migrations and transactions. Overall, an ORM-powered back end accelerates development and ensures a more efficient and scalable e-commerce platform.
